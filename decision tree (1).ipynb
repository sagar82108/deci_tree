    "Q1. Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm:\n",
    "   Decision tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum depth or minimum number of samples in a leaf node. To make predictions, the tree traverses from the root node to a leaf node based on the values of input features, and the majority class in the leaf node is used as the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Mathematical Intuition behind Decision Tree Classification:\n",
    "   Decision trees use impurity measures like Gini impurity or entropy to determine the best attribute to split the data. The algorithm selects the attribute that minimizes impurity, resulting in a more homogeneous subset. The mathematical intuition involves calculating impurity before and after the split and choosing the split that maximizes information gain (reduction in impurity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Binary Classification with Decision Tree:\n",
    "   In binary classification, a decision tree separates data into two classes. The tree recursively splits the data using attributes and thresholds, ultimately classifying data points into one of the two classes based on majority voting in the leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Geometric Intuition in Decision Tree Classification:\n",
    "   Think of decision trees as dividing the feature space into regions. Each split creates a boundary in the space, and leaf nodes represent regions associated with specific class labels. Predictions are made by determining which region the input data point belongs to based on the feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Confusion Matrix and Evaluation:\n",
    "   A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It contains four metrics: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Example Confusion Matrix and Metrics:\n",
    "   |                  | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |\n",
    "   |------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "   | Actual Positive  | 90 (TP)            | 10 (FN)            |\n",
    "   | Actual Negative  | 5 (FP)             | 195 (TN)           |\n",
    "\n",
    "   Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 90 / (90 + 5) = 0.947\n",
    "   Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 90 / (90 + 10) = 0.900\n",
    "   F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.947 * 0.900) / (0.947 + 0.900) â‰ˆ 0.923\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Choosing Evaluation Metric:\n",
    "   The choice of evaluation metric depends on the problem and the consequences of false positives and false negatives. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, recall might be more critical to minimize false negatives, while in spam email classification, precision might be more important to minimize false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Precision-Important Classification Problem:\n",
    "   Email Spam Detection: Precision is crucial because falsely marking a legitimate email as spam can result in important emails being missed, leading to user dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Recall-Important Classification Problem:\n",
    "   Disease Detection: In a medical context, recall is essential because missing a disease diagnosis (false negative) can have severe consequences, whereas a false positive may lead to further tests but is less critical."
